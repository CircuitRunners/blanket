# blanket
The blanket API for FRC robots.

Though WPILib is a suitable API for interfacing with the robot hardwawre, blanket aims to be a suitable API for making robots just work. By providing a high-level coding interface where users can just select sensors and manipulators that are part of a robot, the process of coding a robot is easily accomplished by anyone, even those without programming experience.

The end goal of blanket is to provide a live coding interface where a user can select various electric controllers, joysticks, and other sensors and then change them while the robot is running. This is to allow simple changes such as joystick mapping and speed values to happen without having to deploy to the robot again.
